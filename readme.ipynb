    "- Fast: Should take milliseconds to run\n",
    "- Isolated: Standalone and can be run in isolation, have no dependencies on any outside factors like filesystem or DB\n",
    "- Repeatable: Running a Unit Test should be consistent with its results, that is, it always returns the same result if you do not change anything in between runs\n",
    "- Self-checking: The test should be able to automatically detect if it passed or failed wtihout any human interaction\n",
    "- Timely: A unit test should not take a disproportionately long time to write compared to the code being tested. If you find the code taking a large amt of time compared to writing the code, consider a design that is more testable."
